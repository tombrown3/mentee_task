## Introduction to Git and GiTHub and overview of Python Classes

This page is a five minute read that will provide you with a brief introduction to git and github and their differences and their uses. It also covers an overview of python classes/objects with examples included.

### GIT
Is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of your source code history.

### GITHUB
Is a cloud-based hosting service that lets you manage Git repositories.

### OVERVIEW OF PYTHON CLASSES/OBJECTS
**Class**  A user-defined prototype for an object that defines a set of attributes that characterize any object of the class.
```markdown
**Class Definition Syntax**

class ClassName:
    Statement-1
    
    
    Statement-N
```

**Object** Is an entity that has a state and behavior associated with it. It may be any real-world object like a mouse, keyboard, chair, table, pen, etc. Integers, strings, floating-point numbers, even arrays, and dictionaries, are all objects.

An object consists of :

    State : It is represented by the attributes of an object. It also reflects the properties of an object.
    Behavior : It is represented by the methods of an object. It also reflects the response of an object to other objects.
    Identity : It gives a unique name to an object and enables one object to interact with other objects.
    
    
To understand the state, behavior, and identity let us take the example of the class Student. 

    -The identity can be considered as the name of the student.
    -State or Attributes can be considered as the class, age, or gender of the student.
    -The behavior can be considered as to whether the student is studying or playing.    
    
   Creating an object
   ```markdown
       obj = Student()
   ```
   
   This will create an object named obj of the class Student
   
  **Self method**
  
 1. Class methods must have an extra first parameter in the method definition. We do not give a value for this parameter when we call the method, Python provides it
 2. If we have a method that takes no arguments, then we still have to have one argument.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/tombrown3/mentee_task/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
